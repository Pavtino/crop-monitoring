## Problem statement

This projct is Based on Phd research in deep learning model with Iot to improve crop monitoring. Many research papers in Artificial Intelligence applied to agriculture have mentionned the way that, it is difficult to have result that approach reality because of choice of data and the source of data. to have a good yield production research must make emphasis in most parameters that impact productin many as possible. This project take basic parameters as remote sensing images, climate data, soil data, pass crop production. Other parameters will be real-time environment and soil data come from IoT sensor. The researh is made for agro-industrie but make emphasis on small farmer. So agriculture practice is on parameters that is also necessary.
The system will be essential toot for decision-makers.It provide advices about agricultural pratices, recommend the most suitable crop cultivation and details about fertilizers. 

To be robust, system is based on deep learning model which combine CNN, LSTM and GAN for trainning and prediction. The architecture of system use choegraphy of microservices to dlivers result. system has many source of data, some data will come from Iot sensors.
Our yield prediction model will focus on 6 crops : maize, cocoa, coffee,cotton, cassava banana.

## Target variable: Crop

## Model

CNN(Convolutionnal Neural Network) a supervised deep learning algorithm that is  use for recognition, classification. LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) a supervised deep learning algorithm use for time series. GAN(Generative Adverserial Network) is an unsupervised deep learning algorithm for data generation.
